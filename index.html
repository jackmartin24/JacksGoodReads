		<strong>Hello, welcome to my site.</strong>
		My name is Jack and I like to read books so I decided to create my site based off of some books that I enjoyed to read.
		I mainly read sci-fi and fantasy books so the reviews will all be about those genres and if I can remember how the book made me feel.
		I will also be giving a summary which I get from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">this site</a>.
		If the book I am reviewing is part of a series the summary will only be of the first book but I will give my review to the series as a whole.
